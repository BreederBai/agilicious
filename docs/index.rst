Welcome to agilicious's documentation!
======================================

Agilicious is a co-designed hardware and software framework tailored to autonomous, 
agile quadrotor flight, which has been developed and used since 2016 at the Robotics 
and Perception Group (RPG) of the University of Zurich. 
Agilicious is completely open-source and open-hardware and supports both model-based 
and neural-network-based controllers. Also, it provides high thrust-to-weight and 
torque-to-inertia ratios for agility, onboard vision sensors, 
GPU-accelerated compute hardware for real-time perception and neural-network inference, 
a real-time flight controller, and a versatile software stack.
In contrast to existing frameworks, Agilicious offers a unique combination of flexible 
software and high-performance hardware. Agilicious has been used in over 30 scientific 
papers at our lab, including trajectory tracking for drone racing scenarios at up 
to 5g and 70km/h, vision-based acrobatic flight, obstacle avoidance in both structured and 
unstructured environments using solely onboard perception, and hardware-in-the-loop simulation 
in virtual-reality environments. Thanks to its versatility, we believe that Agilicious supports 
the next generation of scientific and industrial quadrotor research.
