           7.2	Neither party shall use the names or trademarks of the other, its related

           respective authorities, without the prior written consent of the party so affected.
           7.3	Each party is acting as an independent contractor and not as an agent, partner,

           and the envisaged economic purpose of the ineffective respectively, invalid provision.
