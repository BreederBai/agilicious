Code Documentation
==================

For code documentation, we now use `Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>`__!

At the moment, the documentation files are not provided and have to be built locally:

1. Install doxygen `sudo apt install doxygen`
2. Run doxygen in the root folder `agilicious/` by simply issuing the `doxygen` command.
3. Open the documentation in your favourite browser by clicking `agilicious/docs/html/index.html`!
